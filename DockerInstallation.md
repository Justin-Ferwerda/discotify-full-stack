# Discotify Installation using Docker

I am happy to offer a totally containerized version of Discotify! If you are familiar with Docker, this will be a breeze.

```git@github.com:Justin-Ferwerda/discotify-full-stack.git```

Create a .env in /discotify-full-stack/discotify and place the api keys according to the [sample env](/Discotify/public/images/sampleEnv.png).

While in the root folder, type

```docker compose up```

The build process should take about two minutes, once the api and web services are up and running, navigate to localhost:3000 and you should be good to go!
